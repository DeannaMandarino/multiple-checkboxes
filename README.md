# Inbox Layout with Multiple Checkbox Selection

A modern and responsive inbox layout that mimics Gmail-like functionality, allowing users to check multiple checkboxes with a "Shift-click" feature. This project demonstrates a clean, minimalist design that is fully responsive and features smooth interactions for managing multiple email items at once.

## Description

This project creates an interactive email inbox with a series of email items. Each email is represented by a section containing a checkbox, sender, subject, and message preview. Users can select multiple checkboxes simultaneously by holding down the "Shift" key and clicking on different checkboxes, making it easy to manage multiple emails at once. The layout uses Flexbox for responsiveness, and media queries adjust the grid to fit various screen sizes.

The project includes:

- **Multiple Checkbox Selection**: Users can select multiple checkboxes by holding down the "Shift" key.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design adapts to various screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Subtle hover effects and layout adjustments for a polished user experience.
